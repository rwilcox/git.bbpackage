A BBEdit package to make working with Git easier
===================================================

The great thing about BBEdit packages in BBEdit 10 is the fact that everything is gathered together in one place. This package contains useful tools for BBEdit & Git.

This package is part "code you can find elsewhere on the internet" (the Git Blame and diff language modules, for example), and new stuff that I just wrote.

Installation
============

    $ cd Library/Application\ Support/BBEdit/
    $ mkdir Packages # if it doesn't already exists
    $ cd Packages
    $ git clone https://github.com/rwilcox/git.bbpackage.git

And restart BBEdit.
